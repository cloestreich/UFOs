# UFOs
**Just fyi: the app.py is the challenge file.  The app_1.py file is from the module.  They're located in the "js" folder inside the "statice" folder.

## Purpose of Analysis
To create a web page with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that will be able to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.

## Results
When a viewer scrolls below the article, they will have the ability to search based on date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO sighting. A search can be completed with one or multiple filters at time.  Below are pics of the website, the filter portion of the site, and when just Fresno is filtered.

By typing in Fresno as the filter, the result returns 1 match. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click 'Filter Table' to initiate the filter. To reset the filter criteria, delete the info in the filter boxes and press Enter.

## Summary

A drawback of this website is the ablity to update it with new UFO sightings and the filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. 

A recommendation for the the website could be updated with a discussion board for fans to comment on post or share their own stories.

Another recommendation would be that they could consider changing the format of date to "MM/DD/YYYY" so that international visitors can look for the correct date of a sighting.
